# l-Multilinear Ranks from Tensor Flattenings

This repository contains Mathematica code for computing the l-multilinear ranks (l-multiranks) of an order-n tensor, representing multipartite quantum states, via tensor flattenings.

## Features
- Computes flattenings along arbitrary subsets of modes.
- Calculates the rank of each flattening.
- Useful for analyzing entanglement structure in multipartite quantum systems.

## Requirements
- Mathematica 12+ (earlier versions might also work)
